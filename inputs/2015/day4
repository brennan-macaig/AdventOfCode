Hi there!

You've probably looked at Day4's code and seen that there is no input file, but I told you to check this file out anyways.

This file is particularly useless for only this challenge. At the time of my writing this, it is the only challenge that I
know of for Advent of Code where I can't use a file. Why can't I use a file, you ask? Easy! When I took the MD5 of abcdef
stored in this file, the hashes were not quite right... It turns out it's because of the way I'm digesting these files.

So I decided to just ignore the file in this case.

Anyways, here's my puzzle input: iwrupvqb
