# AdventOfCode Puzzles
Advent Of Code puzzles, as solved by me, Brennan Macaig.

All the ways of doing these puzzles are my own with no research first. I'm not doing one a day, nor am I doing them ASAP - I'm working on them when I get a chance. 5 minutes here, 2 hours there, etc.

Here's how long each day took me:

*Day 1* - 15 minutes
*Day 2* - 2 hours
*Day 3* - 30 minutes
